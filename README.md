## Getting started ðŸš€

- `git clone https://github.com/Aryanpal20/jira-clone.git`
- Install [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) if you don't have it already and create a database ( there is also a docker compose file if you prefer using docker, just run `docker-compose up` inside the backend folder)
- Create an empty `.env` file in `/backend`, copy `/backend/.env.example` contents into it, and fill in your database username and password.
- `pnpm install`
- `npm run dev`
- App should now be running on `http://localhost:5137/`
